  Introduction={In this paper, a novel DPC variant DPC-MFP is presented. DPC-MFP uses multiple feature points to represent each cluster, as opposed to DPC where a cluster is 
represented by one cluster center point. Moreover, DPC-MFP represents multiple feature points of each cluster without the need for manual selection by the cluster center of DPC.  
The multiple feature points used in DPC-MFP are not only better able to adapt and represent clusters with complex structures in different datasets, but also reduce the influence of 
human factors. Furthermore, in order to improve the accuracy of the algorithm, DPC-MFP improves the allocation of the remaining points. All non-featured points are divided into 
two categories and different allocation methods are used.}

We will make the code publicly available after the paper is accepted.
